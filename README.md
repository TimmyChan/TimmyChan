## Background
_Mathematician interested in creating technology for virtual learning environments, foregrounding the principles of Universal Design for Learning. Deeply interested in learning and implementing multidisciplinary approaches to complex questions._

- M.A. in Mathematics from [San Francisco State University](http://math.sfsu.edu/)
- Research interest focused on in mathematical learning in virtual environments, with emphasis on applying Universal Design for Learning principles. This blends works from Learning Sciences, Disability Studies, UX design, VR/AR interactive design with mathematical disciplinary mastery. 


## Currently Projects
- I'm currently strengthening my skillset through practice by solving problems on Project Euler. Literature review has been core to my skillset, so I'm currently learning the definitons of markov processes with a goal of implementing multi-agent reinforcement learning as defined by Russell and Norvig (2022), by replicating some procedures outlined by AI researchers to understand unsupervised learning (Baker, 2022; Leibo, 2019). Apparently to understand the theory we need at least #linearalgebra, #combinatorics, #probability, #statistics, #analysis and convex #optimization first. _Thank God I actually enjoy math homework so much that I end up assigning some to myself..._
- I'm working on [Curriculum Mapper](https://www.github.com/timmychan/curriculummapper), a visualization tool using NetworkX and BeautifulSoup to reverse engineer learning trajectories via prerequisite relationships in publicly accessible university bulletins.
